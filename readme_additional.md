* Need to start the virtual environment with this command: **.venv\Scripts\activate**

* Run **deactivate** to shut down the virtual environment.

* Run **.\make html** to build the docs.

* For GitHub, need to add this line to the index.html file in the root of the /docs directory.  I have stored a copy of this file in the root of the project:
    * <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=./html/index.html" />

* Put a .nojekyll file in the root of the project directory.

* Need to create a /docs folder as per this article: https://python.plainenglish.io/how-to-host-your-sphinx-documentation-on-github-550254f325ae
