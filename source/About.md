## About this site

This site is built with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/ "The best static site generator for documentation"), a Python-based static-site generator specifically designed for documentation and a Docs-as-Code approach.  To deploy this site, I created a virtual environment in VS Code and installed the Sphinx package with PIP.  I then configured the project to use [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown "Markdown on wikipedia") files as the source.
