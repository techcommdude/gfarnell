# About me

I'm a Senior Technical Writer in the Toronto, Canada area with an interest in helping Developers be more productive with useful documentation.  I'm driven to create content for customers, partners, and internal developers that makes it easier to find the critical information they require for a successful implementation and user experience. I love being part of a team that strives to deliver a world-class product.

## About this site

This site is built with <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/" target="_blank" title="The best static site generator for documentation" rel="noopener">Sphinx</a>, a Python-based static-site generator specifically designed for documentation and a Docs-as-Code approach.  To deploy this site, I created a virtual environment in VS Code and installed the Sphinx package with PIP.  I then configured the project to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank" title="Markdown on Wikipedia" rel="noopener">Markdown</a> files as the source.
